# Campaign Optimization Engine

A high-performance, distributed system for optimizing advertising campaigns across multiple platforms in real-time.

## Features

- **Dynamic Campaign Allocation**: Intelligently distributes ad campaigns across various platforms
- **Real-time Predictive Analytics**: Uses machine learning for bid optimization
- **Multi-threaded Processing**: Handles concurrent campaign processing efficiently
- **Distributed Architecture**: Scales horizontally for high-load environments
- **Fault Tolerance**: Ensures system reliability and data consistency

## Core Components

### Campaign Manager
- Handles campaign lifecycle and state management
- Implements thread-safe operations using mutexes
- Uses priority queues for bid request processing

### Predictive Analytics
- Real-time CPC and CVR predictions
- Market condition analysis
- Confidence scoring based on data quality
- Caching for performance optimization

### Decision Engine
- Multi-factor bid optimization
- Dynamic strategy selection
- Time-based and budget-based adjustments
- Decision caching for efficiency

### Platform Integration
- Google Ads API integration
- Rate limiting with token bucket algorithm
- Real-time performance metrics tracking

### Messaging System
- Distributed communication using message queues
- Topic-based publish/subscribe model
- Buffered channels for high throughput

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

2. Configure platform credentials:
   ```go
   creds := &platform.Credentials{
       ClientID:     "your-client-id",
       ClientSecret: "your-client-secret",
       RefreshToken: "your-refresh-token",
   }
   ```

3. Create a campaign:
   ```go
   manager := campaign.NewManager(10) // 10 concurrent workers
   campaign, err := manager.CreateCampaign(
       1000.0,          // Budget
       10000,           // Target reach
       2.5,             // Target CPA
       []Platform{PlatformGoogle, PlatformMeta},
       startTime,
       endTime,
   )
   ```

4. Start the campaign:
   ```go
   ctx := context.Background()
   err := manager.StartCampaign(ctx, campaign.ID)
   ```

## Architecture

The system uses a distributed architecture with the following components:

```

                              ▼                         ▼
                        ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐

                        └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

## Performance Considerations

- Uses efficient data structures (priority queues, caches)
- Implements rate limiting to prevent API overload
- Employs concurrent processing with worker pools
- Caches predictions and decisions for optimal performance

## Error Handling

- Graceful degradation under high load
- Circuit breakers for external API calls
- Comprehensive error reporting
- Automatic retry mechanisms

## Monitoring

The system provides real-time metrics for:
- Campaign performance
- System throughput
- Error rates
- Resource utilization
